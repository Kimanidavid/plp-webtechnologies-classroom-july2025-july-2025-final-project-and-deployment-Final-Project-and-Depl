# ImageGallery (Project)
[Live Website](https://gallery-alpha-amber.vercel.app/)


## Quick start (Windows)

1. Open the project folder in your editor or File Explorer.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser:
   - Double-click `index.html` in File Explorer, or
   - Use VS Code Live Server extension: right-click `index.html` -> Open with Live Server.

## Contact form (client-side)

The contact form uses client-side JavaScript validation and does not submit to a server by default.

To test:

1. Scroll to the "Contact Us" section near the bottom of the homepage.
2. Submit with invalid values to see inline error messages (empty required fields, invalid email, short message).
3. Submit valid values â€” a success message will appear and the form will reset.
